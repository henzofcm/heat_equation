# Let's solve the heat equation with Python!

As this is part of my Linear Algebra courses final exam, I try to use most of the techniques learned so far by
solving numerically the one-dimensional heat equation using python. Basically we used the difference matrix and the Euler's method.
Some different boundary conditions were added so you can also analize the diffusions behaviour in all its aspects.

## Results

Inside the .\src\ directory you will find each module. Just run them and the images will be generated in .\img\.
